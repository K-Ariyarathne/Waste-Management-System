# Smart Automated Dustbin with Waste Management System

## Introduction

The Smart Automated Dustbin with Waste Management System is an innovative solution designed to address the challenges of inefficient waste disposal and management. By integrating advanced technologies such as sensors, actuators, and communication modules, this project aims to automate the process of waste collection and disposal, ensuring a more sustainable and organized approach to waste management.

## Features

- **Automated Waste Collection:** Utilizes sensors to detect when the dustbin is full and automatically triggers the collection process.
- **Efficient Waste Sorting:** Incorporates mechanisms to sort waste into recyclables, organic waste, and non-recyclables.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Equipped with communication modules to enable real-time monitoring and management of waste levels and collection schedules.
- **Eco-friendly:** Aims to optimize resource usage, reduce environmental impact, and promote recycling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors for level detection)
- Actuators (e.g., motors for lid opening)
- Communication module (e.g., Wi-Fi or GSM module for remote monitoring)

### Installation

A step-by-step series of instructions that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Step 1: Set up Firebase Realtime Database
Go to the Firebase console and create a new project.
Set up the Realtime Database in your Firebase project.
Note down your Firebase project credentials.

Step 2: Set up the Sensors and Send Data to Firebase
Use the "Setup the all sensors and send data to firebase" file to set up your ESP32 and connect it to the Realtime Database.
Make sure your sensors are properly connected to the ESP32.
The code will send sensor data to the Firebase Realtime Database.

Step 3: Set up the Web App
Open the "Final HTML File" which is connected with "style.css" and "script4.js".
Make sure the script is properly configured to retrieve data from your Firebase Realtime Database.
Host these files on a web server or open them in a web browser to view the final output.

## Usage

- Place waste items into the dustbin.
- The system automatically detects the waste level and sorts the waste accordingly.
- When the dustbin is full, the collection process is triggered, and the waste is disposed of or sent for recycling.
