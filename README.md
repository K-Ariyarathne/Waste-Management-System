# Smart Automated Dustbin with Waste Management System

## Introduction

The Smart Automated Dustbin with Waste Management System is an innovative solution designed to address the challenges of inefficient waste disposal and management. By integrating advanced technologies such as sensors, actuators, and communication modules, this project aims to automate the process of waste collection and disposal, ensuring a more sustainable and organized approach to waste management.

## Features

- **Automated Waste Collection:** Utilizes sensors to detect when the dustbin is full and automatically triggers the collection process.
- **Efficient Waste Sorting:** Incorporates mechanisms to sort waste into recyclables, organic waste, and non-recyclables.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Equipped with communication modules to enable real-time monitoring and management of waste levels and collection schedules.
- **Eco-friendly:** Aims to optimize resource usage, reduce environmental impact, and promote recycling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors for level detection)
- Actuators (e.g., motors for lid opening)
- Communication module (e.g., Wi-Fi or GSM module for remote monitoring)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Assemble the hardware components based on the provided schematics.

3. Upload the provided code to the microcontroller.

4. Set up the communication module for remote monitoring (optional).

## Usage

- Place waste items into the dustbin.
- The system automatically detects the waste level and sorts the waste accordingly.
- When the dustbin is full, the collection process is triggered, and the waste is disposed of or sent for recycling.
